# HTML binding for teh lulz

* Elegantly binds objects to HTML
* Proxies through jQuery, Ender, or whatever $ is
* Automatic dependency resolution
* Plays well with others

## Examples

* [Basic Overview](http://weepy.github.com/o_O/examples/guide/index.html)
* [TodoMVC Example](http://weepy.github.com/o_O/examples/todos/index.html)

## The Basics

Use `o_O.property(...)` (or the shortcut: `o_O(...)`) to create an evented o_O `property`:

```javascript
var viewmodel = {
  name: o_O.property('Homer Simpson'),
  age: o_O(40) //o_O(...) proxies to o_O.property(...) and is the preferred usage
};

//change a value:
viewmodel.name('Bart Simpson');
viewmodel.age(10);

//get a value:
alert(viewmodel.name());
```

Bind an object to a section of HTML with the `o_O.bind(...)` method, and bind parts of that HTML section to o_O `properties` with the `data-bind` attribute:

```javascript
o_O.bind(viewmodel, '#character');
```
```html
<div id="#character">
  <div data-bind="text: name()"></div>
  <div data-bind="text: age()"></div>
</div>
```

## Digging Deeper

Besides creating basic javascript hashes to contain o_O `properties`, you can also create an o_O `model` (using `o_O.model(...)`) that creates o_O `properties` for you out of the box as well as giving you access to event aggregation:

```javascript
var Character = o_O.model({
  name: '',
  age: 0
});

var homer = new Character({
  name: 'Homer Simpson',
  age: 40
});

homer.on('set:name', function(character, name_new, name_old){
  console.log("Homer's name changed.");
});
```

You can also create an o_O `array` that lets you create an array of o_O `models` and aggregates events across all of them:

```javascript
var characters = o_O.array();

characters.push(new Character({name: 'Homer', age: 40}));
characters.push(new Character({name: 'Marge', age: 36}));
characters.push(new Character({name: 'Bart', age: 10}));
characters.push(new Character({name: 'Lisa', age: 8}));
characters.push(new Character({name: 'Maggie', age: 2}));

characters.on('set:age', function(character, age_new, age_old){
  console.log(character.name + "'s age changed from " + age_old + " to " + age_new + ".");
});

// this will trigger the above 'set:' event for each character:
characters.forEach(function(character){
  character.age(character.age() + 1);
});

characters.on('add', function(new_character){
  console.log(new_character);
});

// this will trigger the above 'add' event:
characters.push(new Character({name: 'Mr. Burns', age: 99}));
```

## Running Tests

Make sure you have installed o_O's development dependencies via npm:

```bash
npm install
```

A subset of tests can be run via the console:

```bash
npm test
```

Or, if you have mocha install (`npm install -g mocha`) you can just run:

```bash
mocha
```

Other tests (that rely on the browser's DOM) must be run in the browser:

```bash
open test/mocha.html
```

## Browser Compatability

Tested in:

* Chrome 16-18
* Firefox 4-10
* Internet Explorer 7-9
* Safari 5
