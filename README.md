# Funnyface.js
## HTML binding for teh lulz

* Elegantly binds objects to HTML
* Proxies through jQuery, Ender, or whatever $ is
* Automatic dependency resolution
* Plays well with others


## Examples

* [Basic Overview](http://weepy.github.com/o_O/examples/guide/index.html)
* [TodoMVC Example](http://weepy.github.com/o_O/examples/todos/index.html)

## The Basics

# o_O properties

Use `o_O(...)` to create an evented o_O `property`:

```javascript

name = o_O('Homer Simpson')

// read a value
name() // => 'Homer Simpson'

// write a value
name('Bart Simpson')
```

o_O properties are evented, so it's possible to bind to a change event: 

```
name.change(function(new_name, old_name) {
  console.log('my name changed from', old_name, 'to', new_name)
})
```

# Computed properties

o_O can also create computed properties:

```javascript
firstName = o_O('Homer')
surName = o_O('Simpson')
fullName = function() {
  return firstName() + ' ' + surName()
}

fullName() // => 'Homer Simpson'
```

A computed property automatically determines it's dependencies and is recalculated whenever a dependency changes:

```javascript
firstName('Bart')

fullName() // => 'Bart Simpson'
```

# HTML binding with o_O.bind

Bind an object to a section of HTML with the `o_O.bind(...)` method, and bind parts of that HTML section to o_O `properties` with the `data-bind` attribute:

```javascript
person = {
  firstName: o_O('Michael'),
  surName: o_O('Jackson'),
  fullName: function() {
    return person.firstName() + ' ' + person.surName()
  },
  age: o_O(50)
}
o_O.bind(person, '#person');
```
```html
<div id="person">
  <div data-bind="text: fullName()"></div>
  <div data-bind="text: age()"></div>
</div>
```

This will render the HTML and retrigger the bindings whenever a dependency changes. So e.g calling `person.firstName('Miss')` will update the HTML.

The binding names are associated with jQuery (or whatever $ is), so css will call $.fn.css. There are also some custom bindings: 

* `foreach` : renders the innerHTML for a list of items
* `value` : two-way binding for forms
* `visible` : hides an element if falsey
* `if/unless` : removes/shows the inner HTML
* `with` : rebinds the context (similar to javascript `with`)
* `options`: options for a select
* `log`: outputs to console.log
* `onbind`: general purpose

Event handlers will also work, e.g. `click: handleClick`.

NB if there's no corresponding binding found, it will simply update the attribute on the element; this is especially useful for attributes such as id, class, src, href

## Digging Deeper

Besides creating basic javascript objects containing o_O `properties`, you can also create an o_O `model` (using `o_O.model(...)`) that creates o_O `properties` for you out of the box as well as giving you access to event aggregation:

```javascript
var homer = o_O.model({
  name: 'Homer Simpson',
  age: 40
});

homer.on('set:name', function(character, name_new, name_old){
  console.log("Homer's name changed.");
});
```

You can also create an o_O evented `array` that lets you create an array of items (can be anything) and if the items support it (i.e. they are o_O `models`) aggregates events across all of them:

```javascript
var cast = o_O.array();

cast.push(o_O.model({name: 'Homer', age: 40}));
cast.push(o_O.model({name: 'Marge', age: 36}));
cast.push(o_O.model({name: 'Bart', age: 10}));
cast.push(o_O.model({name: 'Lisa', age: 8}));
cast.push(o_O.model({name: 'Maggie', age: 2}));

cast.on('set:age', function(character, age_new, age_old){
  console.log(character.name + "'s age changed from " + age_old + " to " + age_new + ".");
});

// this will trigger the above 'set:' event for each character:
cast.forEach(function(character){
  character.age(character.age() + 1);
});

cast.on('add', function(new_character){
  console.log(new_character);
});

// this will trigger the above 'add' event:
cast.push(new Character({name: 'Mr. Burns', age: 99}));
```

The special `foreach` binding will render this list: 

```html
<ul id="cast" data-bind='foreach: cast'>
  <li data-bind="text: fullName() +',' + age()" ></li>
</ul>

<script>
o_O.bind(cast, '#cast')
</script>
```

## Running Tests

Make sure you have installed o_O's development dependencies via npm:

```bash
npm install
```

A subset of tests can be run via the console:

```bash
npm test
```

Or, if you have mocha install (`npm install -g mocha`) you can just run:

```bash
mocha
```

Other tests (that rely on the browser's DOM) must be run in the browser:

```bash
open test/mocha.html
```

## Browser Compatability

Tested in:

* Chrome 16-18
* Firefox 4-10
* Internet Explorer 7-9 
* Safari 5
* Node 6.0

Other browsers should work, (eg IE6) but are currently untested

## Importing to alternate namespace

It's possible to import o_O to an alternative namespace by appending ?mynamespace to the script, for example 

```html
<script src="../o_O.js?oO"></script>
```

will import the library to `window` as `oO`
